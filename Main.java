REMAINING TO-DOs: 
1. In Game, make car into an array of cars and draw that onto the screen. Also do collision detection

2. Change the length of the car, randomize it

3. Make the background look prettier by changing the colors and layout - Arman

4. Figure out how to generate past one screen of backgrounds / plan the layout (on paper first)

5. Draw coin (small yellow square), use collision detection from cars, implement point system

6. Draw starting menu (a rectangle with text) and ending menu
